# MiniRedis

> 
## 📝 Description

MiniRedis is an in-memory data structure server that implements a subset of the Redis protocol. While not a production-ready replacement for Redis, it serves as an excellent learning tool for understanding how a key-value store operates. Built from scratch, MiniRedis provides hands-on experience with network programming, data serialization, and concurrency. Explore the fundamental concepts behind Redis by building your own simplified version!
